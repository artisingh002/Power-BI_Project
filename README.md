## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the company to understand their sales better. This dashboard will give a feel of how data analysis projects are executed in big companies. Case study is based on a computer hardware business which is facing challenges in dynamically changing market. Here I build a power BI dashboard that gives us a real time sales insights of a company.

In this project, I will analyze and transform data, and create interactive visualizations, reports, and dashboards by using Microsoft Power BI.
Here I chose sales data of a random company for analysis and visualization. The Quere editing was done in 'MySQL server' and visualization part was done using 'Microsoft Power BI'. Also for analysis, I used Power BI'S query tool.
From the "sales" database, the following tables were chosen for analysis:

- customers.sql 
- date.sql
- markets.sql
- products.sql
- transactions.sql

#### Query Editing Tool: "MySQL"
#### Visualization Tool: "Microsoft Power BI"
